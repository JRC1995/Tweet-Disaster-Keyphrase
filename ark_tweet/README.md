ark-tweet-nlp-python [no longer supported by Ian]
=================================================

**Note** this is _no longer supported_ by Ian Ozsvald, sorry, you're most welcome to fork this. If you are running a living fork then I'd be happy to point users at your repo.

Simple Python wrapper around runTagger.sh of ark-tweet-nlp. It passes a list of tweets to runTagger.sh and parses the result into a list of lists of tuples, each tuple represents the (token, type, confidence). 

Wraps up:

  * https://github.com/brendano/ark-tweet-nlp
  * http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/

Lives here:

  * https://github.com/ianozsvald/ark-tweet-nlp-python

Usage:
-----
   
    >>> import CMUTweetTagger
    >>> print CMUTweetTagger.runtagger_parse(['example tweet 1', 'example tweet 2'])
    >>> [[('example', 'N', 0.979), ('tweet', 'V', 0.7763), ('1', '$', 0.9916)], [('example', 'N', 0.979), ('tweet', 'V', 0.7713), ('2', '$', 0.5832)]]

Note, if you receive:

    >>> Error: Unable to access jarfile ark-tweet-nlp-0.3.2.jar

Make sure you pass in the correct path to the jar file, e.g. if this script is cloned into a subdirectory of ark-tweet-nlp then you may need to use:

    >>> print CMUTweetTagger.runtagger_parse(['example tweet 1', 'example tweet 2'], run_tagger_cmd="java -XX:ParallelGCThreads=2 -Xmx500m -jar ../ark-tweet-nlp-0.3.2.jar")

Notes and possible improvements:
-------------------------------

  * This wrapper calls runTagger.sh's contents via command line, Java takes a few seconds to start - you should send in a list of tweets rather than doing them one at a time
  * Communicating once the shell process is opened rather than closing comms would be more sensible
  * _call_runtagger replaces new-lines in the tweet with a space (as new-lines signify tweet separators in runTagger.sh), this might not be appropriate if you need to maintain new-lines
  * It would probably be awfully nicer if somebody wrapped up a py4J interface so we didn't have to start java at the command line each time (or maybe I shouldn't use .communicate which closes the process and instead keep the process open?)
  * _split_results could do with a unittest, probably the module should turn into a class so you only have to set runTagger.sh's path location once (and it should assert if it can't find the script on initialisation)
  * Really the script should be in a class so it can be initialised with runTagger.sh
